The AssociateProfitSplitter Contract main function is the deposit function. This contract splits the amount deposited by the msg.sender into 3 even amounts and then sends the coins to each of the addresses definied in the constructor. The other functions in the contract are balance which just checks the balance of the contract and the fallback function which is coded to enforce the deposit function is called regardless when the contract is deployed.
